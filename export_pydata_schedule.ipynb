Simple prompting isn’t enough when dynamic interaction with tools, structured data, and live context is required. This workshop introduces the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an emerging open standard designed to simplify and standardise this integration. Aimed at forward-thinking developers and technologists, this hands-on session will equip participants with practical skills to build intelligent, modular, and extensible LLM-native applications using MCP.',\n",
       "     'description': \"Dive into the next evolution of LLM application development with the Model Context Protocol. As LLMs become more capable, the need for a consistent way to connect them with external tools and data is increasingly urgent. This interactive workshop explores MCP as a breakthrough approach to building tool-aware, context-rich AI systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe’ll cover:\\r\\n- Core Concepts of MCP: Understand MCP's client-server architecture and how it enables structured, contextual reasoning — think of it as “USB-C for AI.” Learn how tools and resources are exposed, discovered, and invoked via the protocol.\\r\\n- Development Environment Setup: Get hands-on with a modern Python development stack, including FastMCP, Typer, and Streamlit. Configure access to an LLM backend using either the OpenAI API or a local Ollama instance.\\r\\n- Building MCP Servers & Tools: Learn to expose functions and resources through an MCP server. We’ll walk through a real example — a Wikipedia search-and-summarisation tool — to demonstrate how to define capabilities and serve them in a standards-compliant way.\\r\\n- Client Development (CLI & Web): Build robust clients using Typer for command-line interfaces and Streamlit for web apps. Learn how to discover server tools, invoke them, and manage stateful interactions.\\r\\n- LLM-Orchestrated Interactions: Go beyond prompt engineering. See how LLMs can autonomously select and chain tools via MCP to solve complex tasks. We’ll demonstrate orchestration logic that turns LLMs into intelligent agents — not just text predictors.\\r\\n- Build an AI Research Assistant: Apply your skills by building a working prototype — an AI Research Assistant. This tool will take natural language queries, use an LLM to plan a response, and call MCP tools to search and summarise data in context.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of this workshop, participants will have a working understanding of MCP, a functioning toolchain, and a clear roadmap to building next-generation AI applications.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Should Attend:\\r\\nDevelopers, data scientists, and technical practitioners ready to move beyond basic prompting and explore advanced, structured LLM integration.\\r\\n\\r\\nRequirements:\\r\\nTo get the most from this workshop, attendees should have:\\r\\n- Python 3.11+ installed\\r\\n- Docker (recommended for running the MCP server)\\r\\n- Access to an LLM backend (OpenAI API or local Ollama)\\r\\n- Basic familiarity with Python and the command line\",\n",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the common pattern, yet practical implementations are often brittle, suffering from poor retrieval, ineffective chunking, and context limitations, leading to inaccurate or irrelevant answers. The emergence of massive context windows (1M+ tokens) seems to offer a simpler path – just put all your data in the prompt! But does it truly solve the \"needle in a haystack\" problem, or introduce new challenges like prohibitive costs and information getting lost in the middle? This talk dives deep into the engineering\\xa0realities. We\\'ll dissect common RAG failure modes, explore techniques for building\\xa0robust\\xa0RAG systems (advanced\\xa0retrieval, re-ranking, query transformations), and critically evaluate the practical viability, costs, and limitations of leveraging long context windows for complex\\xa0data tasks in Python.

While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely discussed for tackling this \"needle in a haystack\" challenge, practitioners often face significant reliability issues.

This talk directly addresses this pivotal decision, moving beyond introductory explanations to provide engineers with a framework for evaluating and implementing\\xa0*reliable*\\xa0grounding strategies, acknowledging the common pitfalls of naive approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nAimed at Python-proficient Data Engineers, Scientists, AI/ML Engineers, and Researchers building or evaluating LLM systems for specific datasets, this session is especially relevant for those hitting RAG limits or considering large context architectures. We\\'ll briefly explain the RAG pipeline (Load, Split, Embed, Retrieve, Generate) before critically examining\\xa0*why*\\xa0it often fails: retrieval irrelevance, suboptimal chunking, context limits, and evaluation hurdles. The talk will then explore Python tools and techniques for improving RAG reliability, such as hybrid search, re-ranking, query transformations, metadata filtering, and adaptive chunking.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe session will then dissect the promise and perils of multi-million token contexts. We\\'ll analyze potential benefits like architectural simplicity against drawbacks: API costs, latency, the \"lost in the middle\" issue, potential need for in-context data structuring, and interaction complexity limits. A core segment provides a direct comparative analysis: RAG vs. Long Context across accuracy, cost, latency, scalability, data freshness, implementation complexity, and suitability for different data/tasks. We\\'ll also consider potential hybrid approaches, blending the strengths of both. Comparisons will be supported by data-driven graphs and python code. \\r\\n\\r\\nAttendees will gain a practical decision framework for choosing when to favour robust RAG versus exploring long context models, emphasizing evaluation strategies crucial for both. The talk will summarize key engineering takeaways for building dependable, data-grounded LLM systems.

       "     'description': \"Card testing is one of the largest growing fraud problems within e-commerce payments: criminals try out slightly modified card numbers tweaking a single digit at the time, to discover valid credentials. This leads to millions of fraudulent transactions per month. Once a card is validated, it can be used to purchase expensive goods or be distributed for further use. Detecting this fraud is extremely difficult as there is no direct feedback that can be used to create labels for a ML model.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how can we train a performant ML model without having a distinction between attacks and legitimate transactions? In this talk, we’ll describe how we tackled the labeling issue which has resulted in a production-ready ML model that now processes hundreds of transactions per second.

       "     'abstract': 'Monorepos promise faster development and smoother cross-team collaboration, but they often seem intimidating, requiring major tooling, buy-in, and process changes. This talk shows how Dexter gradually introduced a Python monorepo by combining a few lightweight tools with a pragmatic, trust-based approach to adoption. The result is that we can effectively reuse components across our various energy forecasting and trade optimization products. We iterate quicker on bringing our research to production, which benefits our customers and supports the renewable energy transition. After this talk, you’ll walk away with a practical blueprint for introducing a monorepo in your context, without requiring heavy up-front work.',\n",
       "     'description': 'Many Python product development teams struggle to manage shared code across multiple product repositories. Internal packages seem like a good solution, until releasing and updating them becomes slow, risky, and frustrating. Monorepos offer a compelling alternative, but often come with perceived challenges: steep tooling requirements, inflexible processes, or the need for top-down mandates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Dexter, we provide our customers with an array of renewable energy forecasting and trade optimization products that share many similar components. To iterate quickly, we need to keep teams autonomous, enabling them to make their own product decisions, but at the same time reuse code and ideas from other teams easily, in cases where it can accelerate progress. As team composition and product-market fit are evolving constantly, we also need our code base to support organizational changes and be quick to onboard to. At the same time, we wanted to avoid a large engineering effort to introduce a heavy-handed monorepo solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, we decided to experiment with a monorepo gradually, starting with just two teams. We didn’t rewrite our workflows or adopt heavyweight tools. Instead, we used a small set of simple, open source tools and focused on trust-based coordination and documentation. Today, most of our products are powered by that monorepo, and we’re shipping faster and collaborating more easily. This setup is key for our data science-heavy product suite, as new product features, better forecasting models and smarter trade decision optimizers immediately benefit our customers and support the renewable energy transition.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, I’ll share our playbook:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Why we wanted a monorepo\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pain of shared packages and coordination overhead\\r\\nThe promise of speed and confidence\\r\\n2. Four essential tools (all simple and open):\\r\\n\\r\\npolylith for structure and modularity\\r\\nuv for fast, reproducible dependency management\\r\\ntach for guarding of package boundaries and selective testing\\r\\nADRs for lightweight decision making and tracking\\r\\n3. Organizational tactics:\\r\\n\\r\\nStart with a real use case, instead of a mandate\\r\\nRemain flexible: don’t enforce what doesn’t hurt\\r\\nDocument shared norms as they emerge\\r\\nLet success stories pull other teams in\\r\\n4. Lessons and ongoing challenges:\\r\\n\\r\\nKeeping CI fast and scoped\\r\\nAvoiding “free rider” effects\\r\\nMaking cross-team decisions without blocking progress\\r\\nThis talk is for engineers and tech leads in multi-team environments who are interested in monorepos, but hesitant about the cost and coordination.

Attendees may leave equipped with: uncertainty guarantee understanding in classification, identify common pitfalls that lead to biased uncertainty estimates, how to apply it (even in difficult contexts like imbalanced datasets - an example will be given).\",\n",
       "     'description': 'This talk is centered around estimating uncertainty with unbiased guarantees, especially in imbalanced dataset scenarios. The method proposed to approach this problem is Conformal Prediction. Conventional classifiers give point predictions but rarely communicate their confidence, often leading to overconfident decisions (especially in high-stake domains like Medicine). Conformal prediction fills this gap by producing prediction sets that contain the true label with a user–specified probability (e.g., 90%) without assuming any particular data distribution. Imbalanced datasets make the above a huge hurdle and SMOTE is not of any help. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed talk structure is (but not limited to):\\r\\n\\r\\n- What do we mean with guarantees and why is it important? (MNIST example)\\r\\n- How the hall can we get out of this? \\r\\n- Imbalanced datasets are even more difficult to be dealt with. What now?\\r\\n- As a user, how can you estimate unbiased uncertainty guarantees?\\r\\n- Remember, Conformal Prediction is a recipe and there are always different ways or ingredients that may fit a use-case better (quick overview over classification focused CP alternatives).\\r\\n\\r\\nTarget audience: Curious people. They may call themselves Practicing Data Scientists, ML Engineers or researchers at times but basic ML understanding would be sufficient to keep up with the talk. No PhD in Stats required <- guaranteed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk is unique among all prior PyData conformal prediction sessions—unlike the time‑series focus at PyData Seattle\\u202f2023, the large‑scale forecasting angle at PyData London\\u202f2024, the energy‑grid case study at PyData Eindhoven\\u202f2023, the MAPIE library deep‑dive at PyData Global\\u202f2024, the gentle intro in Amsterdam\\u202f2024, the sktime/skpro probabilistic workshop in Amsterdam\\u202f2023, the regression‑only focus in London\\u202f2019 PyData- as is the first to deliver provably unbiased uncertainty\\u202fguarantees for general classifiers on a multi‑class playground like MNIST and (more importantly so) in imbalanced datasets.',\n",

       "     'description': 'For most companies one of the top marketing priorities is to increase the Customer Loyalty towards their brand and products and therefore increase the lifetime value from their customers. One of the ways that companies try to achieve this is to onboard customers onto their app. While mobile App users tend to have higher engagement and retention rates, often generating more profits through direct purchases, the challenge lies in determining if this is due to app installs or if high value customers are more likely to install the app. The ideal way to measure the causal impact of an app install would be to set up a randomized controlled trial, but this is impractical as we cannot force users into treatment (install the app) and control (do not install) arm. Therefore, we leveraged observational causal inference methods to understand the incremental value of an app install, where we compared app users to non app users. The biggest challenge of using observational causal inference for business decision making is to demonstrate stronger evidence for causal conclusions and address biases from confounding, selection and measurement, which can result in an underestimate or overestimate of the effect of interest. Our work aims to address these concerns by exploring covariate selection strategies, different statistical approaches, refutation methods and design-based approaches. The estimated causal effects from this study helped the business to identify the most valuable install acquisition channels and optimize the app marketing spend to drive more incremental CLV. This work can be considered part of wider efforts to improve the transparency and robustness of observational causal inference studies by thoughtful application of multiple approaches (statistical and design based) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Our next step is to implement  a comprehensive sensitivity analysis to further strengthen our causal claims.',\n",

Dust off your Raspberry Pi––let’s build a custom on-air sign with Apache Kafka®, Apache Flink®, and Apache Iceberg™!\\r\\n- We’ll begin by writing Python scripts to capture key events––such as when a Zoom meeting is running and when a camera is being used––and produce it into Kafka. The live data are then consumed by a Raspberry Pi script to drive the operation of a custom designed on-air sign. From there, you’ll be introduced to the ins and outs of FlinkSQL for stream processing as we wrangle the data into a better format for downstream use. And, finally, we’ll see Iceberg in action and learn how to use query engines to analyze meeting and recording trends.\\r\\n- By the end of the session, you’ll be well-acquainted with this powerful trio of open source technologies and know how you could use the same scaffolding and scale out a simple, at-home project to millions of users and simultaneous events.',\n",

This talk connects that lived experience to the bigger picture: how the absence of women shapes the systems we build. Companies with more women in senior leadership see stronger culture, higher engagement, and even higher profits. Biologically, women are wired to handle stress, countering the myth that they’re less suited for high-pressure leadership. And when half the world is missing from the teams designing our products, their perspectives are missing from the data which means the systems we build are biased by design.\\r\\n\\r\\nI’ll share what it takes to stay in a field that keeps quietly asking if you belong and why I stayed anyway.

In most organizations, the deployment of GenAI applications is on the rise, and this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Evaluating GenAI systems presents unique challenges not present in traditional ML. The main peculiarity is the absence of ground truth for textual metrics such as: text clarity, location extraction accuracy, factual accuracy and so on. Nevertheless the non-negligible model serving cost demands an even more thorough evaluation of the system to be deployed in production. \\r\\n\\r\\nDefining the metric ground truth is a costly and time consuming process requiring human annotation. To address this, we are going to present how to evaluate LLM-based applications by leveraging LLMs themselves as evaluators. Moreover we are going to outline the complexities and evaluation methods for LLM-based Agents which operate with autonomy and present further evaluation challenges. Lastly, we will explore the critical role of evaluation in the GenAI lifecycle and outline the steps taken to integrate these processes seamlessly. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhether you are an AI practitioner, user or enthusiast, join us to gain insights into the future of GenAI evaluation and its impact on enhancing application performance.',\n",

None of us would ever deploy a classical ML model to production without clearly defined metrics and proper evaluation, so let's talk about methodologies for measuring performance of LLM-powered chatbots. Think of retriever recall, answer relevancy, correctness, faithfulness and hallucination rates. With the wild west of metric standards still in full swing, I’ll guide you through the challenges of curating a synthetic test set, and selecting suitable metrics and open-source packages that help evaluating your use case. Everything is possible, from simple LLM-as-a-judge approaches like those inherent to many packages like MLFLow now up to complex multi-step quantification approaches with Ragas. If you work in the GenAI space or with LLM-powered chatbots, this session is for you! Prior or background knowledge is of advantage, but not required.\",\n",
       "     'description': '[min 0-4] Introduction: A brief overview of common LLM-powered chatbots (RAG, agentic). Focus will be on a high-level structure, highlighting the sections we’ll want to evaluate later (retriever, QA-chain)\\r\\n\\r\\n[min 4-5] Motivation: To optimise performance we first need to identify the performance of the individual elements. We need a standardized measure to understand if optimising leads to measurable improvements.\\r\\n\\r\\n[min 5-7] Step 1, the evaluation dataset: Curating a suitable test set is key for comprehensive metrics. Manually creating a test set is tedious, Ragas offers a set of tools that allow to generate a synthetic test set. I will give an overview over the tools for test set generation and show examples. The examples will be later used with the evaluation metrics.\\r\\n\\r\\n[min 7-20] Step 2, metrics for RAG evaluation: I will showcase with examples a set of metrics that allows for a fast comparison and covers the complete RAG pipeline. The goal is not to be exhaustive, but rather give the attendees a set of metrics that have been shown to be useful in combination with each other. This covers:\\r\\n- Metrics to evaluate the document retriever performance: Context Precision (proportion of retrieved documents that are relevant to the query) and Context Recall (number of relevant documents were successfully retrieved)\\r\\n- QA-Metrics: Evaluate the chatbot response with respect to the user question in terms of Answer Relevancy and with respect to the ground truth in terms of Answer Correctness, as well as Faithfulness that evaluates answer with respect to context.\\r\\nOpen-source packages: For each of the metrics above, we’ll compare how various packages (MLFlow, DeepEval, Ragas) calculate these metrics.\\r\\n- Custom metric Hallucination Rate that measures the likelihood of hallucination\\r\\n\\r\\n[min 20-25] Agentic and other metrics: Ragas also offers possibilities to evaluate the tool workflow of agentic frameworks, e.g. through Tool Call Accuracy, and additional general purpose metrics like the Summarization Score. The goal here is to give a short impression of these additional metrics that the package offers\\r\\n\\r\\n[min 25-30] Conclusion: As a conclusion I offer tips and tricks on how to select the best metric for your use case. The goal is that the attendees walk away with some concrete metrics they can use to evaluate their RAG/agentic frameworks and empowers them to dive deeper into the functionalities that the Ragas package offers.',\n",

       "     'description': 'The City of Amsterdam is known for continuously experimenting with AI and its commitment to the responsible adoption of emerging technologies. Naturally, this includes a strong focus on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to make municipal processes and services not only more efficient but also more transparent, inclusive, and user-friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, while LLMs offer plentiful opportunities, they also come with significant risks. One of the most critical decisions in designing LLM systems is the choice of an underlying model - one that aligns with the needs and values of the City and its citizens. But what are these values? And how do we ensure that LLMs meet them?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address these questions, our team has been working to empower the City of Amsterdam and inspire the Dutch government to responsibly implement LLMs by creating a comprehensive overview of their performance, environmental impact, and alignment with human values.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this talk, we will share our ethical considerations when employing LLMs and walk you through the aspects that experts and users find most important to evaluate. We will discuss how we translate these values into measurable benchmarks and curate datasets tailored to Dutch governmental needs. Finally, we will showcase our dedicated LLM benchmarking platform, which can be used to assess LLMs and inspire others to adopt them responsibly.',\n",

Context engineering involves providing LLMs with relevant and timely context data from various data sources, which allows them to make context-aware decisions. The context data provided to the LLM must be produced in real-time to enable it to react intelligently at human perceivable latencies (a second or two at most). If the application takes longer to react, humans would perceive it as laggy and unintelligent.\\r\\nIn this talk, we will introduce context engineering and motivate for real-time context engineering for interactive applications. We will also demonstrate how to integrate real-time context data from applications inside Python agents using the Hopsworks feature store and corresponding application IDs. Application IDs are the key to unlock application context data for agents and LLMs. We will walk through an example of an interactive application (TikTok clone) that we make AI-enabled with Hopsworks.',\n",

We exemplify our approach with a real-world application in large-scale monitoring environments from the online payment domain.',\n",
       "     'description': 'In time-series monitoring, item-level data - such as clicks, transactions, or service requests - is typically aggregated into pre-defined groups based on measurable categorical features (e.g., country, operating system, integration version). The resulting time series are then analyzed for significant shifts in distribution with anomaly and drift detection pipelines.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, when the dimensionality or cardinality of the available categorical features is high, the naive stratification based on a pre-defined list of features often leads to a highly imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the time-series: a small subset of time-series contains the vast majority of observations, while the remainder comprises series with very few data points. Time-series based on a small number of items are unsuitable for reliable monitoring and are generally excluded from further analysis, resulting in incomplete coverage of the underlying item space. Moreover, heuristic or static grouping strategies frequently fail to produce homogeneous series in terms of the monitored metrics. Ideally, items exhibiting similar behavioral characteristics — those prone to fail or shift together — should be grouped within the same time-series. Without a principled approach, disparate items may be inappropriately grouped, resulting in noisy, non-informative, or misleading time-series.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis presentation introduces a systematic framework for learning an “optimal” hierarchy of categorical features for stratification. We begin by formally defining the framework and optimization objectives, followed by a comparative analysis of greedy and non-greedy algorithms designed to solve the partitioning problem efficiently. Given the computational intractability of exhaustively searching over all feature permutations, the described methods emphasize scalability and principled feature selection.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo illustrate the efficacy of our approach, we will present case studies from the payments domain, demonstrating how we reduced the number of monitored time-series from millions of heterogeneous streams to thousands of homogeneous time-series, simultaneously increasing the coverage and detection power.',\n",

This project serves as a practical example of applying advanced AI techniques to enhance creative technical work, demonstrating how a specialized retrieval system can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of data visualization creation process.',\n",
       "     'description': '## Description\\r\\n\\r\\nMy professional work revolves around Python, but my creative passion lies in crafting data visualizations with R and ggplot2, where I regularly participate in community challenges like #TidyTuesday and #30DayChartChallenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike many visualization creators, I draw inspiration from the community\\'s collective work—studying their geometric choices, color palettes, thematic elements, and annotation techniques. I particularly learn from examining contributor code on GitHub for #TidyTuesday challenges. Over time, I\\'ve tried various approaches to organize this inspiration: Pinterest boards, manual tagging in Notion pages, Twitter bookmarks, and screenshots. However, the sheer volume of remarkable visualizations being produced has overwhelmed my manual curation processes, and I realized I\\'m spending more time cataloging charts than actually creating them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe limitations of my conventional organization methods became clear because:\\r\\n\\r\\n- They required tedious manual tagging and organization.\\r\\n- They lacked any semantic search capabilities to find visualizations.\\r\\n- They existed in disconnected silos, making comprehensive searches impossible.\\r\\n- They could not scale with the exponentially growing visualization community.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an AI engineer by day, I realized this challenge was a perfect use case for a RAG-based retrieval system. By creating an intelligent search tool specifically designed for data visualizations, I could transform my scattered collection of inspiration into a searchable knowledge base. Instead of scrolling through endless saved charts or GitHub repositories, I could simply search with natural language queries like, \"I\\'m looking for a geofaceted map of Europe on a dark background,\" or, \"Show me circular charts that use a sans-serif font in their title.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nImplementing RAG for this domain proved particularly challenging because I\\'m dealing primarily with images. Simply embedding visual features from visualizations didn\\'t yield satisfactory results. I needed to develop a hybrid approach that effectively processes both textual elements (code, descriptions, titles) and visual components. In this talk, I\\'ll present my methodology for distilling data visualizations into searchable embeddings that capture both visual characteristics and conceptual elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project brings together AI and data visualization—two areas that rarely meet. Though it uses RAG technology, the main goal is to help create better visualizations more easily. What began as fixing my own workflow problem could benefit many others in the visualization community. It\\'s a practical example of how different technologies and tools can significantly improve the efficiency and quality of the data visualization creation process.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Time Breakdown\\r\\n\\r\\n- **My Personal Struggle with Viz Inspiration (5 min):** Setting the stage by discussing the challenge of managing diverse data visualization inspiration, the overwhelming volume of community-shared data visualizations, and the limitations of manual curation.\\r\\n- **Deconstructing Visualizations for AI (7 min):** How we can break down data visualizations into searchable components, drawing parallels with the \"Grammar of Graphics\" to inform our AI-driven approach.\\r\\n- **Building a Hybrid RAG System: Strategies & Challenges (8 min):** Dive into the practicalities of creating a RAG system for visual content, focusing on the hybrid embedding techniques that combine image and text features and the hurdles faced.\\r\\n- **Live Demo: Searching for My Next Chart (5 min):** A live demonstration of the visualization search application in action, showcasing natural language queries and retrieved results.\\r\\n- **Key Takeaways & Future Directions (5 min):** Summarizing the main learnings, discussing future development ideas, and broader applications of this AI-powered approach.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Target Audience\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk is ideal for data visualization practitioners or creatives who are looking for smart ways to organize and improve their workflows, or AI engineers exploring practical applications of RAG systems on visual data.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Specialized Tracks\\r\\n\\r\\n- Data Science & Analytics\\r\\n- Machine Learning & Deep Learning',\n",

       "     'abstract': \"Generative models are dominating the spotlight lately - and rightly so. Their flexibility and zero-shot capabilities make it incredibly fast to prototype NLP applications. However, one-shotting complex NLP problems often isn't the best long-term strategy. Decomposing problems into modular, pipelined tasks leads to better debuggability, greater interpretability, and more reliable performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis modular pipeline approach pairs naturally with zero- and few-shot (ZFS) models, enabling rapid yet robust prototyping without requiring large datasets or fine-tuning. Crucially, many real-world applications need structured data outputs—not free-form text. Generative models often struggle to consistently produce structured results, which is why enforcing structured outputs is now a core feature across contemporary NLP tools (like Outlines, DSPy, LangChain, Ollama, vLLM, and others).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor engineers building NLP pipelines today, the landscape is fragmented. There’s no single standard for structured generation yet, and switching between tools can be costly and frustrating. The NLP tooling landscape lacks a flexible, model-agnostic solution that minimizes setup overhead, supports structured outputs, and accelerates iteration.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroducing **Sieves**: a modular toolkit for building robust NLP document processing pipelines using ZFS models.\",\n",
       "     'description': 'In NLP, implementing pipelines of established tasks is a common practice. Prototypes that require little to no data are often very valuable during early system development, as fully supervised models typically demand extensive annotated datasets. Generative and predictive zero-/few-shot (ZFS) learning models address this limitation by eliminating the immediate need for full annotation, enabling a “warm start” over a “cold start” with fully supervised models. This approach accelerates development and enables faster feedback loops.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite the richness of the open NLP ecosystem, there currently is no toolkit supporting rapid task prototyping with ZFS models without tight coupling to a specific (1) model, (2) structured generation library (e.g. https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy, https://github.com/dottxt-ai/outlines, https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer, https://github.com/BoundaryML/baml) or (3) task. All three components should be as interchangeable as possible to improve on the developer experience and efficacy. sieves aims to fill this gap.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Agenda\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will cover the following topics:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **The Value of Pipelines and Task Isolation**: Exploring their usefulness as abstractions, even when using generative models.\\r\\n- **Warm Starts With Prototyping**: How to iterate effectively without relying on a training set.\\r\\n- **Overview of Structured Generation Tools**: A summary of the current landscape in structured generation.\\r\\n- **Introducing Sieves**: Bringing it all together with pipelines, warm starts/prototyping, and structured generation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe largest part of the presentation will focus on sieves, its core concepts, and its benefits:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Loose coupling**: Decoupling models, tasks, and structured generation backends for flexibility.\\r\\n- **Unified I/O format**: Standardized input/output formats across models, tasks, and structured generation backends.\\r\\n- **Generative and predictive ZFS support**: Compatibility with both approaches for versatility.\\r\\n- **Document- and pipeline-based architecture**: Designed for maintainability and easy debugging.\\r\\n- **Comprehensive task support**: Comes with plenty of task implementations for ZFS regimes, enabling single-line execution for tasks such as: vlassification, NER, entity linking, guided information extraction, REL, translation, summarization, etc.\\r\\n- **Auxiliary component integration**: Support for essential tools often needed in practical NLP workflows, e.g. for file parsing and chunking.\\r\\n- **Customizability**: Lightweight encapsulation of tasks, allowing users to easily customize or add new tasks.\\r\\n- **Supervised training support**: Enables compilation and export of training, validation, and test datasets in popular formats like Hugging Face’s datasets to simplify model distillation on LLM output.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Takeaways\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the end of this talk, attendees will understand:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **The Benefits of Pipelines and Prototyping For Warm Starts**: How pipelines and warm starts - leveraging prototypes with ZFS techniques - can speed up the development of NLP applications, also when using generative models.\\r\\n- **The Role of Structured Generation in Building Real-World NLP applications**: Insights into the current state of structured generation for text models and its impact on task implementation.\\r\\n- **Contributions of Sieves**: The place of sieve in the NLP ecosystem and how it contributes to a smoother and more productive developer experience in building out NLP applications by simplifying prototyping and accelerating development.',\n",

From Bayesian models to neural networks, the variety is huge, and the learning curve steep.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk helps you skip the theory maze and get hands-on with two lesser-known, practical models that are easy to implement with Python:\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Level Set Forecaster**: a simple wrapper that turns any existing point forecast into a probabilistic forecast using a nonparametric approach. Ideal if you already have a point model in place. \\r\\n- **Quantile Regression Forest**: a powerful variation of Random Forests that outputs a probabilistic forecast, offering sample-specific uncertainty estimates.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough powerful, these models are often buried in academic papers, making them hard to approach.

Each team utilizes their own tools, workflows, and expertise. Coordinating data pipeline creation across such diverse teams presents significant challenges. These include complex inter-team dependencies, inconsistent scheduling solutions, and rapidly evolving requirements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk is aimed at data engineers, platform engineers, and technical leads with experience in workflow orchestration and will demonstrate how we empower teams at Vinted to define data pipelines quickly and reliably. We will present our user-friendly abstraction layer built on top of Apache Airflow, enhanced by a Python code generator. This abstraction simplifies upgrades and migrations, removes scheduler complexity, and supports Vinted’s rapid growth. Attendees will learn how Python abstractions and code generation can standardize pipeline development across diverse teams, reduce operational complexity, and enable greater flexibility and control in large-scale data organizations. Through practical lessons and real-world examples of our abstraction interface, we will offer insights into designing scheduler-agnostic architectures for successful data pipeline orchestration.',\n",

Background & Motivation\\r\\n- Describe Vinted\\'s organizational landscape—multiple product verticals, autonomous data teams, and shared infrastructure.\\r\\n- Surface typical challenges: duplicated pipeline code, diverging scheduler solutions, migration issues, and silos across dbt, Docker-based, and ML workflows.\\r\\n- Explain the need for abstraction and unification to unlock velocity and safety at scale.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Abstraction Layer Design\\r\\n- Present our user-facing abstraction API for describing pipelines, regardless of job type or runner.\\r\\n- Discuss how we enable standardization without constraining teams\\' unique needs or technical stacks.\\r\\n- Show how this API hides Airflow and scheduler-specific details, facilitating upgrades (e.g. Airflow 3.0, or a completely new scheduler tool).\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Python Code Generation & Deployment\\r\\n- Walk through our automated code generation tool.\\r\\n- Generating Airflow DAGs for dbt repositories, Dockerized data jobs, and Google Vertex-AI (ML) pipelines. How configuration and validation happen at code-generation time during CI, minimizing surprises at runtime.\\r\\n- How we deploy interconnected DAGs independently with declarative dependencies between data assets using a global data asset registry (metadata, SLOs, and owner information).\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Outcomes, Lessons Learned, & Future Directions\\r\\n- Quantifiable impact: reduced pipeline delivery times, improved reliability, more autonomous teams.\\r\\n- Operational benefits: easier scheduler upgrades, standardized monitoring, and simplified incident management.\\r\\n- Lessons on balancing central guardrails and team autonomy.\\r\\n- Ideas for \"scheduler-agnostic\" evolution: how our abstractions would allow us to seamlessly upgrade to Airflow 3.0 and support new runtimes (e.g. On-prem kubernetes tasks) in the future.',\n",
