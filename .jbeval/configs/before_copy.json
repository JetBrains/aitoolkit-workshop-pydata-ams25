Your role is to assess whether two outputs convey substantially the same core information and meaning, even if expressed differently, with allowances for variations.\nYou will receive:\n\nA Task description.\nA Reference Output (ground truth).\nA Model Output to evaluate.\n\nTo evaluate:\nThink step-by-step in \u003cthinking\u003e tags:\u003c/thinking\u003e\n\nIdentify the key facts, ideas, concepts, and essential information in the Reference Output.\nIdentify the key facts, ideas, concepts, and essential information in the Model Output.\nCompare them for semantic similarity: Do they substantially align in overall meaning and core content? Allow for paraphrasing, synonyms, reordered elements, different structures, casing, whitespace, minor additions, omissions, or non-critical details. Focus on whether the essence is preserved, not on exact wording or precision.\n\nAssign one of two integer scores: 0 or 1, according to:\n\n1: Substantially matches semantically (conveys mostly the same key information and meaning, with allowances for variations that don\u0027t alter the core essence).\n0: Does not substantially match semantically (significant deviations, missing core information, major inaccuracies, or fundamentally different meaning).\n\nHere are examples to guide your evaluation:\n\u003cexamples\u003e\n\u003cexample1\u003e\nTask: Summarize the plot of the fairy tale.\nReference Output: A young girl visits her grandmother but encounters a wolf disguised as her.\nModel Output: The story involves a child going to see her grandma, only to find a wolf pretending to be her.\n\u003c/example1\u003e\nExpected Response: {\"score\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Substantially equivalent; same core events and characters, just rephrased.\"}\n\u003cexample2\u003e\nTask: List the capitals of European countries.\nReference Output: France - Paris, Germany - Berlin, Italy - Rome.\nModel Output: France - Paris, Spain - Madrid, UK - London.\n\u003c/example2\u003e\nExpected Response: {\"score\": 0, \"explanation\": \"Does not match; includes different countries and capitals, altering core information.\"}\n\u003cexample3\u003e\nTask: Explain photosynthesis.\nReference Output: Plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen using chlorophyll.\nModel Output: Through chlorophyll, vegetation transforms CO2, H2O, and solar energy into sugar and O2.\n\u003c/example3\u003e\nExpected Response: {\"score\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Conveys the same scientific process and components, despite varied wording, abbreviations, and synonyms.\"}\n\u003cexample4\u003e\nTask: Describe the benefits of exercise.\nReference Output: Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health, strengthens muscles, and boosts mental well-being.\nModel Output: Working out routinely enhances heart function, builds muscle strength, reduces stress, and promotes better mood.\n\u003c/example4\u003e\nExpected Response: {\"score\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Substantially matches core benefits with paraphrasing and minor expansions, preserving the essence.\"}\n\u003c/examples\u003e\n\nRespond only with a JSON object containing \"score\" (0 or 1) and \"explanation\" (a brief justification).
